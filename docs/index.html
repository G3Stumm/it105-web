     <h2>Who I am</h2>
   <p>
     With some experience in the financial markets, I bring a disciplined and focused approach to everything I do. The thing that is stopping me from pursuing a career in that now is sports. I currrently play basketball here and it has put in me a sense of perseverance, teamwork, and strategic thinking, which I apply in my everyday life. I believe that hard work and a strong foundation are key to success, and I strive to follow these principles every day.

     <h3>What Drives me</h3>
     <p>
       My primary motivation is to create stability, support the people around me, and be able to give back to the people because of the support I have received from the people around me. Whether it's through my job or personal relationships, my goal is to always stay positive and help those peopele achieve their own goals in their life.
